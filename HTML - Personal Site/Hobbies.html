    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have always been fascinated by a wide range of activities. This goes from playing music to playing sports.
    <ul>
      <li>Running and Cycling: these are the sports I am liking the most at the moment. I'm not afraid of setting big goals like running a marathon etc.</li>
      <li>Piano and guitar: piano was the first instrument I have learned, later on I started teaching myself how to play the guitar. Eventually I took lessons in both.</li>
      <li>Reading: I like to read both fiction and non-fiction books. A list of what I've read so far can be found on my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124911232-laura-burgelman">GoodReads</a> account.</li>
